# Phishing-Detection-Web-App

# Description:
In this project, we are training a model to detect phishing websites using GradientBoost Classifier(GBC). Phishing websites are those which steal user's personal data(credentials,account informations etc) and use it to threaten the user.

# Dataset:
Our dataset consists of a collection of website URLs for 11000+ websites. Each sample has 30 website parameters and a class label identifying it as a phishing website or not (1 or -1).

# How to run:
You need to run the app.py file which is used to import model.pkl that is the saved model after training it. You will then get the link to the website which contains a text-box where you need to enter the site which you want to test. Clicking on the 'click here' button, you will be shown with the result whether the site is safe to go or not along with the site above the result. Then you can choose either to go further or step back.
